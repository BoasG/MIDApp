# MIDApp 
MID is an Android app that allows you to subscribe, create tasks, edit and save them for future use.

How to use it for now:
- Get the backend from https://github.com/boh21/HBV-MID
- Read readme there to set it up on intellij
- Get the frontend here and pull it to android studio

1. Go to localhost:8080 online and sign up as Username: PrufuUser (!!Very important!!), password and email are required but can be anything
     - You should see the sign up button below the login function
3. Now sign into your account with the username ("PrufuUser") and password you chose
4. Create as many tasks as you would like with different categories and priority
5. To view your tasks (for now just the names), go to the main page on the android app and navigate to view tasks page
6. There you should first see all the tasks you have created
7. You can use the search function to search for a task by name and when you press enter the tasks with that name should appear
8. You can also use the filter to filter out tasks.
    - There are three types of filters in the drop down
        - Priority (High or low)
        - Category 
        - Status
    - By choosing as manu filters as you would like, you can find tasks that apply to your selected filters
         - Attention: If no priority filters (or both) are chosen, tasks with both priority criteria will be shown
         - The same goes for the category filters and status
